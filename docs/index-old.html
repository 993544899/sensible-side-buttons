            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>If you use third-party mice with your Mac, you've surely noticed just how useless the side buttons are. By default, they act as a sort of crippled middle click, consigned to opening new links when you least expect it. Compare this to Windows, where these buttons allow you to navigate back and forward in practically any window with a history. Once you've gotten used to this, it's hard to go without it.</p>

            <p>The most common fix for this problem is to map the useless side buttons to <code>⌘+[</code> and <code>⌘+]</code> — fairly standard, OS-wide shortcuts for navigating history. You can find this kludge in everything from Logitech's own software to third-party tools such as USB Overdrive. This works in most applications, but unfortunately it still doesn't feel very natural. You either get a distracting menu bar blink or an obnoxious alert sound whenever you click one of the side buttons. The commands apply to the entire application, not to the view under your cursor — in contrast to the way every other mouse button works. Behavior can be unpredictable in some contexts, indenting text and switching windows when the application doesn't map the command key shortcuts as expected. In other words, you can't rely on this approach.</p>

            <p>With SensibleSideButtons, order is finally restored to the long-suffering navigation buttons. Navigation works in practically any application with a history. Commands are targeted strictly to the view under your cursor. There's no blinking menu bar, no annoying noises, no fear of errant keyboard shortcuts messing with your workflow. And best of all, the code is nice, native, and clean. All we're doing is dusing off a bit of forgotten macOS functionality.</p>

            <p><img src="bar.png" width="100%" /></p>

            <p>SensibleSideButtons lives in your menu bar. That's really about it: while it's up there, you'll get the fancy new back/forward behavior, and when it's gone there's no trace of it left. (You can also open the menu and selectively enable or disable it as you please.) There's no CPU overhead, no uncomfortable system hooks — just some system events getting sent out when M4 or M5 is clicked.</p>

            <h2>Technical Notes</h2>

            <p>I've suffered with poorly-behaving side buttons on all my third-party mice for years, to the point where I just assumed that the problem was unfixable. Then I got my hands on the MX Master, and I was shocked to find that the side buttons on <em>just that one mouse</em> behaved in my ideal, Windows-esque way in macOS. No blinking menu bars... navigation localized to whatever view was under your cursor... consistent behavior in practically every app. It was a dream come true!</p>

            <p>Wondering if I could port the behavior to all my other mice, I whipped out Xcode and started trying to unravel the problem. First question: what was the standard, expected macOS behavior for the side buttons? Capturing the button presses of several of my mice, I found that the side buttons emitted standard M4 and M5 commands just as they did in Windows. Unfortunately, these commands fell on deaf ears on the OS side, and they couldn't be rebound in any native way.</p>

            <p>Inferring that the Master was doing something special with its side buttons, I tried capturing them as well. To my surprise, they appeared to emit nothing! My guess was that perhaps the Logitech driver was doing something interesting to make them work this way. But what was it? The Master's side buttons behaved in a completely standard way across all my apps, so it probably wasn't some special Logitech code. There had to be some sort of global previous/next event in macOS that was being emitted here. But after hours of Googling, I coudln't find any evidence of such an event existing.</p>

            <p>A bit stumped, I decided to try capturing events from my MX Master again — only this time, not just the button presses, but any event at all. This finally captured the side button presses! But they weren't presses at all, but... fake side swipe gestures!</p>

            <p>Pre-10.6, macOS used to have a three-finger swipe gesture that could navigate in most apps. Under the hood, this was basically free to implement: all you had to do was include a <code>swipeWithEvent:</code> selector in your view controller and you were good to go.</p>

            <p>In other words, this was as close to a global, standard back/forward event in macOS as you could get! Unfortunately, it required sending out an event that could not be created programmatically. (Does Logitech have special access from Apple to do this, or do they fake it?)</p>

            <p>The hard part was figuring out how to fake the event and send it out. Fortunately, this turned out not to be hard at all: Asdf Asdfovich did all the work already with his reverse-engineered NSEvent manipulator. Playing around for a bit, I came upon the configuration that would get me exactly the same event as the Master was sending out.</p>

            <p>In order to convert button presses to fake swipes, </p>

            <h2>Demo</h2>

            <p>The video below is divided into three parts, each demonstrating one of the above approaches to mapping the side mouse buttons in macOS. The orange circle represents the back button and the blue circle represents the forward button.</p>

                </video>
            </p>

            <p>As you can see, native macOS behavior is completely useless, the keyboard shortcut approach has some flaws and edge cases, and the SensibleSideButtons swipe approach is very nearly perfect.</p>

            <h2>Credits</h2>

            <p>SensibleSideNotes is made by me — Alexei Baboulevitch. You can find me on Twitter @ <a href="">archagon</a>, and e-mail me at <a href="">ssb@archagon.net</a>. My blog can currently be found at <a href="http://beta-blog.archagon.net">http://beta-blog.archagon.net</a>.</p>

            <p>SensibleSideNotes is free because a) I believe this is precisely how side mouse buttons should be mapped in macOS, and b) I'm just so elated to finally have functional side buttons again! However, if you find that the app has improved your productivity as much as I think it will, please consider leaving a small donation or buying something through my Amazon affiliate link. I'd greatly appreciate it and it will help fund this and many other useful projects.</p>

            <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
